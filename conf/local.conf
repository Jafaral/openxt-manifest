# Shared-state files from other locations

# Shared state files are prebuilt cache data objects which can used to
# accelerate build time. This variable can be used to configure the system to
# search other mirror locations for these objects before it builds the data
# itself.
#
# This can be a filesystem directory, or a remote url such as http or ftp.
# These would contain the sstate-cache results from previous builds (possibly
# from other machines). This variable works like fetcher MIRRORS/PREMIRRORS
# and points to the cache locations to check for the shared objects.
